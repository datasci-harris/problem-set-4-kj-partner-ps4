Given that the American Hospital Association's report (https://www.aha.org/system/files/2018-02/2018-aha-hospital-fast-facts_0.pdf) lists there as only being 5534 hospitals in country in 2016, this data needs to be processed and cleaned to be useful.\n",
        "    b. Accoding to the American Hospital Association's report , there were 4840 community hospitals in 2016. Because the report states that short-term hospitals are a subcategory of community hospitals, it does not make any sense of there to be more short-term hospitals than community hospitals. We suspect that this differs because the way hospitals close is not appropriately tracked. Closed and inactive hospitals are probably included in the unprocessed data.\n"
